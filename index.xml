      <description>The Power of Dreams I&amp;rsquo;m a chill young developer rising through the ranks, passionate about dreams and how they have shaped my life. I believe in the power of the subconscious - how our waking mind is just 20% of what makes us who we are. Dreams are powerful tools, recognized even from biblical days with Joseph and his coat of many colors, interpreting Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s dreams.&#xA;Why Lucid Logs? I wanted to build this app to help us connect with our subconscious more deeply, to understand what our dreams might be telling us.</description>

      <description>Eye-Tracking AAC System Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) refers to the field of emerging technologies that utilizes communication systems to aide or supplement speech or writing for those with impairments or difficulties communicating.&#xA;It allows people to regain or enhance certain communications skills usually impaired by congenital conditions or acquired maladies such as autism or cerebral palsy.&#xA;Inspiration I was captivated by a particular episode of Breaking Bad where Hector Salamanca, a paraplegic and mute character, is being questioned by the DEA.</description>
