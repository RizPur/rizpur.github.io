      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking maybe this article isn&amp;rsquo;t really about learning Chinese at all.&#xA;Im listening to Jden song where he says, &amp;ldquo;I write songs like these ones, simply as distractions to make me feel like im doing something bigger than my passions .. but im just lying to myself again&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Maybe this piece is my version of that.&#xA;Some days I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m writing this to inspire my future daughters.</description>
