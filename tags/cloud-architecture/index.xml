      <description>After Hurricane Melissa, Brian messaged me on Instagram. He sells me a vision his friend Travis has, on a solution.

The team formed organically—people who believed Jamaica deserved better disaster response infrastructure. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t just Brian and Travis. It was us. All of us.</description>
