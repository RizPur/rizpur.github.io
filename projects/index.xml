      <description>After Hurricane Melissa, Brian messaged me on Instagram. He sells me a vision his friend Travis has, on a solution. I message them back on Whatsapp.&#xA;What started as a conversation between three people quickly became something bigger. Old university friends. Current friends. Good friends. New friends. The team formed organically—people who believed Jamaica deserved better disaster response infrastructure. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t just Brian and Travis. It was us. All of us.</description>

Patterns waiting to be found. Your subconscious speaks to you every night in symbols, emotions, recurring themes—and most of us never learn to listen.&#xA;What if we could analyze dreams the same way we analyze data?</description>

      <description>Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) refers to the field of tech that utilizes communication systems to aide or supplement speech or writing for those with impairments or difficulties communicating.&#xA;It allows people to regain or enhance certain communications skills usually impaired by congenital conditions or acquired maladies such as autism or cerebral palsy.&#xA;Inspiration I was captivated by a particular episode of Breaking Bad where Hector Salamanca, a paraplegic and mute character, is being questioned by the DEA.</description>
