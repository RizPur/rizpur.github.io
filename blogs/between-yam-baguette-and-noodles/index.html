          <article class="page-content  p-2">
          <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking maybe this article isn&rsquo;t really about learning Chinese at all.</p>
<p>Im listening to Jden song where he says,
<em>&ldquo;I write songs like these ones, simply as distractions to make me feel like im doing something bigger than my passions .. but im just lying to myself again&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Maybe this piece is my version of that.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m trying to understand why I even feel the need to write something like this.<br>
Or who I’m becoming to even <em>want</em> to write something like this.</p>
<p>Or maybe deeper down im writing this just for an ego boost., convincing myself that nothing is impossible — for me, for another Jamaican or Caribbean.</p>
<p>Some days I feel like I&rsquo;m writing this to inspire my future daughters.
Other days… maybe it&rsquo;s just for an ego boost.
And there are moments when I wonder if I&rsquo;m simply documenting a mind in transition.</p>
<p>But to understand why I’m here now — learning Chinese, thinking about eastern philosophy, crawling under tables with cheese — you have to understand where it started.</p>
<h2 id="the-two-job-life-that-shaped-me">The Two-Job Life That Shaped Me</h2>
<p>For three years in Kingston, my life was split right down the middle.</p>
<p><strong>Digicel 8–5. (more like 10 - 5 if im being honest)<br>
Alliance Française 6:30–8:30.</strong></p>
<p>IT by day. French by night.<br>
That rhythm felt… right. Purposeful. Disciplined. Like my own version of that Japanese philosophy where you commit to one craft deeply until it becomes a pillar of your life.</p>
<p>IT was my career.
French was my side hustle.
Kingston was my world — the taxi man dem and the driving, the heat, Red Hills traffic, and the long drives to Mobay where I met every kind of human: Jamaican, Cameroonian, French, Australian, Japanese, American, South American.</p>
<p>Those drives — 3/4 hours, windows down, music loud, everybody telling stories or arguing about politics or weed or football — shaped me more than I realized at the time.</p>
<p>And I thought that was it.</p>
<p>But life didnt end there.</p>
<p>Those years were the first time I started thinking about China.</p>
<p>In tech, China was already big.<br>
In Jamaica, China was <em>everywhere</em> — construction sites, business fronts, the highway to Ochi that changed how we move across the island.<br>
Even in my stomach — chicken chow mein was bussing.</p>
<p>I remember countless rides discussing Chinese investment, the ganja economy, tourism, “if Goat Island sale worth it,” and hearing people from all over the world share their versions of the truth.</p>
<p>Those conversations made me feel like the world was bigger than Kingston.<br>
And maybe, just maybe, I needed to see it for myself.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="coming-back-to-france">Coming Back to France</h2>
<p><strong>(Not China but close enough)</strong></p>
<p>Life moved. I moved.<br>
I came to France for my master’s.</p>
<p>And that’s when the unexpected happened.<br>
I enrolled in Chinese.</p>
<p>Chinese wasn&rsquo;t in the plan.<br>
China wasn’t in the plan.<br>
Tones, characters, Taoism, dynasties — none of it was part of the vision.</p>
<p>But somehow it became part of <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>And after a year, I found myself asking:</p>
<p><strong>Have I changed too much?</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="guilt-in-growth">Guilt in Growth</h2>
<p>Some days, I wonder if I’m helping Jamaica as much as I could be.<br>
If I’m becoming too French. Too Chinese. Too “global,” whatever that means.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder if Jamaica’s selling of Goat Island was worth it—if it could symbolize the start of something bigger between Jamaica and China. A bridge. Opportunities. Education. Work. Philosophies meeting. Cultures mixing. Sometimes I feel hopeful about that. Other times I feel like a traitor for even thinking it.</p>
<p>Have I betrayed the country that raised me?<br>
The soil that grew the yam I ate for 25 years?<br>
Did I trade callaloo and dumpling for baguette and noodles?</p>
<p>Or Am I just a slave to my own curiosity… and ambition?</p>
<p>Maybe I’m writing this to tell myself it’s okay to grow.
To change.
To experiment with who I could be.</p>
<p>Whatever the truth is, that’s only the beginning of this story.</p>
<p>The rest?<br>
It’s about the people I met along the way, the moments that taught me, and the language that’s shaping me.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-learn-chinese">How I Learn Chinese</h2>
<p>My first-year Chinese teacher was a small, energetic woman who walked into class smiling like she carried sunlight in her pocket. She taught with music, poems, stories about dynasties and her own childhood memories.</p>
<p>When she talked about emperors, traditions, classroom culture in China, it felt like she was opening a window into a world I had never seen. I’d sit there feeling like a little boy, hearing stories for the first time.</p>
<p>And the best part?<br>
<strong>No conjugations.</strong><br>
After French, thats how i know God real.</p>
<p>Same time around then, before leaving Jamaica, I met a Jamaican girl and a Belizean girl who both spoke Chinese at Kingston Language Linkup. Caribbean power. I was shocked. They told me it’s all about experiences — living, talking, being open.</p>
<p>One of them mentioned Taoism and sent me down a whole rabbit hole.<br>
That’s how I found one of the most important stories in this whole journey. I wish I remembered her name but 4 Red Stripes have erased it permanently — but I remember how she made me feel. I share with you this story now :</p>
<h3 id="-the-taoist-horse-story">🍂 The Taoist Horse Story</h3>
<p><img src="/images/blogs/taoist.png" alt="horse"></p>
<p>A farmer’s horse runs away.<br>
The neighbours say, “Bredda, dat wicked, a wah kinda crosses dat?”<br>
The farmer says, <strong>“We’ll see.”</strong></p>
<p>The next day the horse comes back with four wild horses.<br>
The neighbours say, “Yow boss, blessings a rain pon yuh! Big big luck!”<br>
The farmer says, <strong>“We’ll see.”</strong></p>
<p>The farmer’s son tries to ride one of the wild horses and breaks his leg.<br>
The neighbours say, “Lawddd star! Dis nuh look good at all!”<br>
The farmer says, <strong>“We’ll see.”</strong></p>
<p>The army comes to recruit all the able-bodied young men for war, but the son can’t go because of his broken leg.<br>
The neighbours say, “Yow boss, yuh lucky enuh! If him foot never bruk, dem woulda carry him gone!”</p>
<p>And the farmer?<br>
<strong>“We’ll see.”</strong></p>
<p>That story looked simple at first, but it came back to me in the weirdest, realest moments later.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="-一粒米天地">🌾 一粒米天地</h3>
<p><strong>“One grain of rice holds the grace of all of Heaven.”</strong></p>
<p>When I think back to those drives across Jamaica, the random conversations with foreigners, the jokes, the arguments, the box food…<br>
all of that felt small at the time.</p>
<p>But looking back?<br>
Those were the grains of rice.<br>
Tiny moments holding the whole sky of who I became.</p>
<p>Even this week, I emailed that same Chinese teacher from last year, and she responded with another expression:</p>
<p><strong>“One inch of sunshine is worth more than a pound of gold.”</strong><br>
一寸光阴 一寸金</p>
<p>It lifted me.<br>
Made me feel seen.<br>
It reminded me that we’re all just boosting each other in small ways.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="learning-through-life">Learning Through Life</h2>
<p>But&hellip;today the electrician came.
We talked in French.
I made mistakes—still, after 15 years of French &amp; 2 years in France—but it was fine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile me inside:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blogs/burning.png" alt="burning dog meme"></p>
<p>He did his thing fixing my stove then I asked him to help me figure out why the front door light wasn&rsquo;t working. The man took out <em>l&rsquo;ampoule</em>, put it in another socket, and it lit up instantly. He looked at me with that “yuh seet deh” smile and said:</p>
<p><strong>“Voilà le problème.”</strong></p>
<p>And my dumbass said:</p>
<p><strong>“ Ahh bah oui, évidemment c’est l’ampoule.”</strong></p>
<p>He laughed because I was <em>completely</em> wrong — the bulb was fine. It was the socket.
I joined the laugh too because damn — it was obvious.</p>
<p>And then there was the plumber.
He came to fix the dishwasher, changed <em>les vannes</em>, and somewhere in the middle of his speech about the importance of strong piping he threw out:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Il faut vivre avec son temps.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>I asked him what it meant and he hit me with a:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Bahhh… faut vivre avec son temps.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Bro basically said the same thing twice like it was a riddle. But the second time?
It clicked.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been thinking about that line for two weeks now.
I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s one week away from becoming my ScotiaBank password phrase.</p>
<p>Évidemment.</p>
<p>Even just tonight, I crawled under the table holding cheese because I had just learned how to say “I am under the table with cheese” in Chinese — and if I don’t <em>live</em> the sentence, I won’t remember it.</p>
<p>Ridiculous moments, that’s how I grow.</p>
<p>And then life reminded me of the Taoist horse again.<br>
The electrician left. Everything was working.<br>
Suddenly the whole apt lose light.<br>
My stove short circuited again.<br>
My Crocs broke.</p>
<p>But right after that chaos, I got an email with an internship opportunity.</p>
<p>Bad luck? Good luck?<br>
<strong>We’ll see.</strong></p>
<h2 id="so-what-am-i-even-saying-">So What Am I Even Saying ?</h2>
<p>I guess learning Chinese wasn’t really about Chinese.<br>
It was about the small things: a misdiagnosed lightbulb, a French plumber’s ass crack of wisdom in my kitchen, a teacher’s soft heartedness, a roommate’s “Did you eat?”, a girlfriend’s laugh when I am under the table with cheese like a madman.</p>
<p>From Jamaica to France to China and back again, nothing big happened.<br>
Just a thousand tiny moments that changed the way I move through the world.</p>
<p>So maybe this journey isn’t about achievement.<br>
Maybe it’s just about paying attention.</p>
<p>I’m not abandoning Jamaica.<br>
I’m just widening the borders a little — enough for baguette and noodles to sit beside the yam.</p>
<p>But if I had to choose between yam, baguette, or noodles, we all know the real answer will always be:</p>
<p>Rice.</p>
